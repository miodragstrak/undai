  "bio": "With over 25 years of experience working with public and private universities, international projects, the financial sector, and companies, I operate at the intersection of education, mentoring, and real-world AI implementation. Through long-term mentoring of young people and professionals, I focus on making artificial intelligence understandable, practical, and independently usable. In parallel, I actively design and implement AI systems — from automation pipelines and AI agents to production-ready solutions in real business environments. My approach combines academic insight, mentoring experience, and hands-on AI development."
